    "a": "I've used TypeScript before. It's quite amazing... Definitely worth learning if you already know JavaScript. But the main reason i use it is because in Visual Studio Code (which you should be using with it) gives a very good auto complete from your typings. That said, writing very large projects in TypeScript is not as easy as doing it in JavaScript, so i stopped doing this, since i realized i can place the typings as definition files (.d.ts) and the code editor does the magic for me.\nAs a conclusion, I'd just say know what it does for you, what it doesn't and if you really want to use it."

This happened because old e4 and elemental lite started as <em>just</em> the element renderer, and that approach worked fine, until you add a trillion popups, highly dynamic data, and a settings page with 9 tabs (2 were left out of the real game), it is very cancer. my other lesson would be to think more about code structure and if something isn't a working idea, don't stick with it until the end (e4 is a huge mess because theres this folder called `shared` which does not depend on any node/browser apis, and could theoretically be imported to allow the e4 server to be played on a separate client, but this is a bit too far and not a good abstraction, as this now limits what interaction these apis have with the game itself)"
