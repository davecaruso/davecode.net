  Dave Caruso is a computer science student in Michigan. he loves spending time
  tinkering with computers, and has self taught himself programming from the age of 9, and
  continued studying advanced web and game development ever since (he made this site from
  scratch). choosing to be an expert on <a href="//">JavaScript</a> and <a href="//">TypeScript</a>
  quirks, and web development with <a href="//">React</a> and <a href="//">Svelte</a>, he has also touched many other areas of
  programming, including desktop apps, software addons, and using other languages like <a href="//">Python</a>, <a href="//">C++</a>, and <a href="//">C#</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from computer science, he has a new passion for music, and is currently learning how
  to write, play, record, and produce music, as well as create videos to go with them. All
  of his projects take a huge inspriation from a similiarly-styled musician, <a href="https://billwurtz.com">Bill Wurtz</a>.

  He spends most of his free time being productive for <em>davecode</em>, but does allocate
  time to relax with his friends. Dave is writing this chunk, so he is biased, however he
  tells very good jokes and can be the life of the party, but is also a huge introvert so he
  prefers smaller gatherings.
