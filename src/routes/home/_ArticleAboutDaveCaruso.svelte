  I'm a computer science student in Michigan, with a huge interest in computers from the very
  beginning. Starting my adventures into programming from the age of 9, I have slowly built up a
  skill set of various computer science concepts, at dare I say, an <em>advanced</em> level. My favorite
  things to code are full-stack websites and web apps (TypeScript with Svelte and React), but I also
  have a soft spot in game development, as it's where I started learning. Over the years I have also
  learned languages and tools such as Python, C#, Java, and C++, but I dont frequently use them so my
  knowledge is limited in those areas.

  Aside from computer science, I have a passion for music and video production, and I am learning
  how to write, play, record, and produce music, as well as create custom music videos to go with
  them. All of my creative projects take a huge inspriation from

  When not working on <em>davecode</em>, I hang out with my friends and family. etc.
