  I'm a computer science student in Michigan, with a huge interest in computers from the very
  beginning. Starting my adventures into programming from the age of 9, I have slowly built up a
  skill set of various computer science concepts, at dare I say, an <em>advanced</em> level. My favorite
  things to code are full-stack websites and web apps (TypeScript with Svelte or React), but I also have
  a soft spot in game development, as I originated from that area. Over the years, I have learned other
  languages like Python, C#, Java, and C++. Unlike the web, I don't use those extra languages much, so
  my knowledge is limited in those areas.

  Aside from computer science, I have a passion for music and video production. One of my goals with
  davecode is to make original music videos in an abstract art style similar to that of <a

  When not working on <em>davecode</em>, I hang out with my friends and family. etc.
