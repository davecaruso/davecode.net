  davecode is a creative project by dave caruso to take computer software and its artistic and
  automation capabilities to the limits. on it, you can find a collection of his work of all
  mediums, including original music, abstract videos, video games, and the custom software built to
  make his processes go faster.

<p>
  you'll find his art scattered around the internet on other websites; you may have already seen one
  of <a href="/famous-things">his popular projects</a>. however, <em>this</em> site is the main place
  to find all of the content, for free â€” he believes Art is not a product, and therefore should not be
  monetized.

  there is no correct way to explore the site, that is your challenge to solve, but the website is
  designed to make exploration easy. if this website is too hard for you, you can choose to be an <a
