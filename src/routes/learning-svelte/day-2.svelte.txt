  <p>day two:</p>
  <p>
    lemme explain myself a tiny bit. this domain was bought yesterday, 3 years ago, and nothing was
    really on it. that felt wrong. i needed to put something on it, but developing in react was not
    the easiest thing in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    on the side, i've been rewriting the creative toolkit ui in svelte and it's been amazing. truly
    wonderful. so i'm gonna rewrite this site in it since it barely existed anyways.
  </p>
  <p>
    so for today not much fancy stuff. i'm gonna try setting up this site behind the scenes, so for
    example you can still access <a href="/learning-svelte/day-1">day one</a> if you missed it.
  </p>
  <p>maybe i'll also write more. that could be fun.</p>
