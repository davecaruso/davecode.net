        <p>
          For the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/ludwig-2021">Ludwig Jam (2021)</a>, a game jam hosted
          by the livestreamer of the same name, me and a friend made a rage typing game where you
          type missing letters of his stream's captions. It was featured on stream and
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3-MjUVwuYU">on Ludwig's YouTube channel</a>,
          seen by over 700,000 people, and played over 18,000 times on itch.io. It placed fourth in
          over 150 entries, and gave us a prize money of $2,000 to split.
