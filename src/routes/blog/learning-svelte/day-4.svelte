  <p>day four:</p>
  <p>
    a lot of time budget was spent on fixing up yesterdays thing. i want to tone down the complexity
    of these posts for a bit, so i can work on the other projects and pages. today on the site, i
    added an error page. this mostly for my 404 not found pages, but also would handle any
    server-side error.
